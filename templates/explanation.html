    <h2>About This Application</h2>
    <p>
        This web application calculates the diffusion coefficient based on a provided fraction  (Xa) and temperature (T).
        It uses a series of logarithmic and exponential calculations along with predefined constants to estimate the diffusion coefficient.
    </p>
    <p>
        The calculation involves evaluating the diffusion parameters using the provided mathematical model. The result is then compared with an expected experimental value,
        and a relative error is computed.
    </p>
    <p>
        To use the application, go to the calculation page, input your values for Xa and T, and then view the computed results.
